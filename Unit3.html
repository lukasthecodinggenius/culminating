<h2>What is HTML?</h2>

<p>HTML is the programming language that is used to design the structure of webpages. With HTML, you can publish websites containing headings, text, tables, pictures, etc. The elements for HTML can be easier to understand as the language labels pieces of content such as tables, headings and paragraphs</p>

<h2>What is CSS?</h2>

<p>CSS uses the structure of the webpage made in HTML to make it look more presentable. Such as changing colours, different fonts, and other features that improve the quality of webpages. CSS and HTML work together with one another to make a good looking website. CSS is also easy to understand like HTML as the language also labels pieces of content, such as color, background-color, font-family, font-size, etc.
