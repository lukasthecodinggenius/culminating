    Have you ever been playing games and wondered to yourself “Why is my computer running so slow??”. Well a computer has many parts inside of it which all work together to make your computer run. Some of the parts of a computer that I will be discussing will be the processor or a CPU, memory and storage. 

    First up I will be talking about CPU’s. The CPU of a computer is essentially the brain of the computer. It assists with running all of the programs you have open such as video games. If the processor runs really quickly, the programs open will also run really quickly. This is why having a good processor is such an important part of a good computer. It almost runs like a car engines would, If the engine is bigger It will run faster. 
    
    The next part I will be talking about is memory. The primary memory is called RAM, which is also known as random access memory. Basically what RAM does is store the computers short-term memory while It is open. This is the difference between RAM and an SSD or Hard Drive. As they will store data forever until It is deleted by the user. Having more RAM will allow the computer to run more programs and run the programs you have open more smoothy. This is why memory is so important for a computer. If you had less memory. It would mean your computer wouldn’t be able to run many programs on it at once. 
    
    The last part I will be talking about is the computers storage. The computers storage is just as important as all of the previously mentioned parts of a computer. The computers storage stores long-term data, such as photos, videos, as well as documents. If you didn’t have enough space on your computer to store all of these it will cause your computer to run slower. 
    
    In conclusion, all parts of a computer work together to run applications. If one of your components isn’t as good as the others, it will still have a major impact on your computer speed. If your processor is fast, your software applications will run fast. If you have more memory, it will allow your computer to run more applications at once. If you have more storage, it will allow you to save more things on your computer. Thank you for listening to my video essay
